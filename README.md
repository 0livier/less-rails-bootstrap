# Less Rails Bootstrap

Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more. To get started -- checkout http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!

The less-rails-bootstrap project hooks into less-rails (https://github.com/metaskills/less-rails) to provide both compiled and Less CSS source files from the Twitter Bootstrap project within the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline.


## Versioning

This gem will directly track the semantic versioning releases of the Twitter Bootstrap project. Our major and minor versions will always match to theirs. Tho we may have tiny patch level releases specific to this gem.


## Installing

Until I publish this gem.

```ruby
gem 'less-rails-bootstrap', :git => 'git://github.com/metaskills/less-rails.git'
gem 'less-rails-bootstrap', '1.3.0' 
```


## Usage

Coming soon...
